# Windows Wallpaper Manager

A native Windows wallpaper manager built with Tauri v2 and React. It provides a seamless experience for setting both images and videos as your system wallpaper across multiple monitors.

## Features

- Multi-Monitor Support: Automatically detects all active monitors and creates dedicated background windows for each.
- Media Support: Supports standard image formats and video files (MP4, WebM).
- Automatic Thumbnails: Generates and caches thumbnails for all media types using FFmpeg.
- Global Shortcut: Toggle the selection interface at any time (Default: Alt + W, configurable in config.json).
- Session Persistence: Remembers and reloads your last selected wallpaper on startup.
- System Tray Integration: Right-click the tray icon for quick access to app controls, cycling wallpapers, or quitting the app.
- Performance: Built with Rust and React for a lightweight and responsive experience.

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- FFmpeg (must be available in your system PATH for video thumbnail generation)

## Known Issues

- **Launch on Startup**: The "Launch on Startup" feature may not function correctly in some environments due to registry permission limitations or installer configuration. If the application doesn't start with Windows, activate the launch on startup option in the settings.
- **Video Thumbnails**: Video thumbnails require FFmpeg to be installed and available in your system PATH. If you just installed FFmpeg via the installer, a system restart may be required for the PATH changes to take effect.
